Welcome to the graveyard!
These are my early projects.
These projects focus on CSS and PHP, which I started learning before moving on to JS.

Individual READMEs are in each folder.
Projects are not organized chronologically!

Honorable mention:
?? - videogame
I made a server-side powered game that synced with the client-side view.
The server was doing all the calculations and checks, the client just sent requests.
It eventually became an online cookie-clicker-like thing, but I don't have the files anymore. Only thing I found is the video I uploaded below.
