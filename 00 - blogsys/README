00 - blogsys

One of my earliest webdev-related projects, I wanted to make a blog system.
I had to be able to make posts, log in and see a listing of posts on the main page.
This project used PHP and MySQL.

At the time of writing, this is is a link to a video of the site's functionality: https://streamable.com/z3pej

It's all very barebones, but it was a start.
